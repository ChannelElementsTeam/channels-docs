# channels-docs

## TLDR;

Use channels because:

* It replaces email, chat, ..., but is way better!
* Talk online or offline using cool interactive "cards"

Develop on it because:

* No corporate control: open-source, distributed, and competitive
* Get paid in crypto-currency
* No app store:  clone, tweak, share
